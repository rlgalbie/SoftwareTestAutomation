How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program and software is functional and secure through testing. Using testing methods such as black box testing, or Junit tests, I can validate that each program works as intended and is secure.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by trying to put myself in the user's shoes. I ask myself questions like "what will this be used for" and "what would make this more convienent". Things like this help translate user needs into requirements.
How do I approach designing software?
I approach software using a test driven aproach. By writing chunks of code with specific, testable functions, you can have functional and modular code that can be fully tested at the click of a button
